- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeachyBuffalo
- 👀 I’m spend my time playing Soccer, slinging Real Estate, lots of Python, and weekends on Unsalted Beaches (Great Lakes).
- 🌱 I have an understanding of Python and growing that knowledge daily. Also working on Cyber knowledge through CTFs and 'Hack The Box' environments.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects that have a positive impact. Currently working on a Sign-Language AI Translator if anyone wants to contribute (currently private).
